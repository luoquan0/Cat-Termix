/**
 * Host-provided packages.
 *
 * These ship with the Termix server and are never bundled into a plugin:
 * bundling them would give each plugin its own copy of express or React, and
 * a second ssh2 would mean a second set of native bindings. A plugin may
 * depend on anything outside these lists, and that does get bundled.
 *
 * A plugin lists the ones it uses as peerDependencies. Only add a package here
 * when core itself ships it; a library one plugin needs belongs in that
 * plugin's own dependencies, so it can update without a core release.
 *
 * Node builtins are external automatically through platform: "node".
