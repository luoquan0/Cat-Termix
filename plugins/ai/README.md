# AI Assistant

An AI assistant that can read your hosts, snippets, fleets, alerts and automations, and suggest changes for you to approve.

## Features

- Chat with an assistant that can read your hosts, snippets, fleets, alerts, automations, workspaces, network graph and homepage.
- The assistant suggests changes, and nothing is applied until you approve it.
- Can run read-only diagnostic commands on a host if you allow it.
- Open the assistant from the terminal toolbar with the current session as context.
- Works with Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini and any OpenAI compatible provider.
