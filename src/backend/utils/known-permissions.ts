 * permission existed only in memory while its plugin was active, so an install
 * upgrading with a plugin disabled would have had `<plugin>.use` rejected on the
 * next role save. Seeding from the roles themselves means anything an admin was
 * already relying on stays valid, whether or not the plugin ever loads again.
