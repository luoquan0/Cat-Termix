/**
 * Who a plugin is acting as right now.
 *
 * Two ways a plugin gets an actor, and no third:
 *
 *   - A request. A4's HTTP and WebSocket middleware runs the handler inside
 *     runAsActor with the user core already authenticated, so a route handler
 *     acts as the person who called it.
 *   - ctx.asUser(userId, fn), for background work with no request behind it.
 *     That call is always audited.
 *
 * Nothing else. A plugin cannot pass a user id to a guarded ctx method and
 * have it believed, which is what stops the forged-caller class of bug the
 * worker broker had.
 *
 * AsyncLocalStorage rather than a module variable because plugin work
 * interleaves: two requests in flight would otherwise overwrite each other's
 * identity between awaits.
