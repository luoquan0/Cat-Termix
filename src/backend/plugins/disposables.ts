/**
 * Everything a plugin registered, so deactivate can undo all of it.
 *
 * The rule this enforces: a plugin is only as disableable as its cleanup. A
 * listening port, a live SSH session or an interval that outlives deactivate
 * turns "disabled" into a lie, and re-enabling then fails on a port that is
 * still held.
 *
 * Disposal runs in reverse registration order, so a thing torn down last was
 * set up first. Every disposer is isolated: one that throws is logged and the
 * rest still run, because a half-disposed plugin is worse than a noisy log.
