/**
 * The grant check every guarded ctx call goes through.
 *
 * Two things have to be true for a capability to count as granted: the
 * manifest declares it (the plugin asked for it up front) and it is granted in
 * plugin_permission_grants (someone, or the bundling process, said yes). A
 * grant for something the manifest never declared is ignored rather than
 * honoured, so widening a plugin's reach always requires a new manifest the
 * user can see.
 *
 * The cache is invalidated explicitly on every grant change rather than by
 * TTL: a revoke that takes effect a minute later is not a revoke.
 *
 * Every refusal is audited here, so a guard added anywhere in the runtime
 * leaves a trail without each call site remembering to write one.
