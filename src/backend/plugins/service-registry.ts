/**
 * Declared, versioned, per-user-permissioned service contracts between plugins.
 *
 * This is the typed sibling of registry.ts. That one is a bare key/value map a
 * plugin can put anything into; this one only carries services a manifest
 * declared, at a declared version, behind a declared role permission.
 *
 * ## What the permission actually gates
 *
 * Be precise, because there are two unrelated permission systems in this
 * runtime and conflating them is the easy mistake:
 *
 *   - permissions.ts gates what a PLUGIN may do (manifest + admin grant).
 *   - this file gates what a USER may do, through PermissionManager, the same
 *     RBAC check requirePermission() runs on an HTTP route.
 *
 * A service permission is an ordinary role permission string. It shows up in
 * the admin role editor like hosts.view does, and an admin can grant or revoke
 * it per role or per user at any time, whether or not the consuming plugin is
 * installed.
 *
 * The check runs on every call rather than once when the handle is made. That
 * is deliberate and is the whole reason the gate lives in the proxy: a revoke
 * mid-session has to take effect on the next call, with no restart and no
 * reinstall. PermissionManager's per-user cache is already invalidated by the
 * RBAC routes that change a role, so "next call" is immediate in practice.
 *
 * ## Resolution is structural, permission is per-call
 *
 * resolveRequirements only asks "is this service present at a satisfying
 * version". It deliberately does NOT consult any user's permissions:
 * activation is per-instance and permissions are per-user, so gating
 * activation on one user's grants would be meaningless. A user who lacks the
 * permission gets a clear denial from the call instead of the requiring plugin
 * mysteriously failing to start.
